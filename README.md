#   notes
*   nanorc
    *   from [scopatz/nanorc](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc)
    *   slightly modified (added all existing `*.nanorc` files, some were missing in provided nanorc)
    *   might need to rename `normal` to `white` in all `.nano/*.nanorc` for older versions of nano
    *   also `set afterends` only works on fairly new versions of nano
